        <h2>My things</h2>
        <h3><a href="http://www.sysmo.io">Sysmo-NMS</a></h3>
        <p>It is the main project I'm working on these days. <strong>It rocks!</strong> There is a commercial website <a href="http://www.sysmo.io">here</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/supercastframework">Supercast</a></h3>
        <p>The first work on Supercast was made around 2011, when the rfc6455 (WebSocket Protocol) was close to becoming a standard. There were some early implementations of it in Erlang, so I began to learn this nice language. There were no, and in my opinion there still aren't, any libraries/frameworks allowing the creation of <strong>maintainable</strong> applications offering soft real time behaviour to the user interface. Supercast is a solution to this need. I have used it successfully in my current main project Sysmo-NMS.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/sysmo-nms/nchecks">NChecks</a></h3>
        <p>The work on NChecks began with Sysmo, while working on nagios-plugins compatibility. Nagios-plugins are popular because they are so simple to write. But I found there are some major drawbacks. NChecks fixes problems like portability, possibility to store a state between checks, many alternative status. It is a major sub-project success of the Sysmo thing!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ssbx/federation">Federation</a></h3>
        <p>The name means nothing, but it is about a 3D FPS game written entirely in C. I try to only use my FunLibs utils, portable C, and minimal external dependencies. The project only depends on OpenGL, GLEW, SOIL2, GLFW and PortAudio libraries, and run succesfully on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It is a work in progress. Starting it will put you in a scene containing a single textured cube, let you move around, and will play "BANG" when you left clic. The next steps are collision detection, model/scene loading and animations, and a game server for network games. In progress then...</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/funlibs">FunLibs</a></h3>
        <p>While having worked with lot of programming and scripting languages on my projects, I find myself missing some experience in the C language. I've then started to wrote some libs. The first were <a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cargo">Cargo</a>, a simple argc/argv parser and <a href="https://github.com/funlibs/clog">Clog</a>, a log library. After having created some more I decided to create the github <a href="https://github.com/funlibs">FunLibs</a> organisation to host the code in a coherent way. It also include forks of some utilities (mostly modified for CMake compatibility). Most (all) of these libs are used by my Federation pet project.</p>
        
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cglm">FunLibs/CGLM</a></h4>
        <p>An OpenGL math library written entirely in C.</p>
        
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/funlibs/libwave">FunLibs/LibWave</a></h4>
        <p>Wrote my own wave files parser, just for fun.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/funlibs/libshake">FunLibs/LibShake</a></h4>
        <p>Playing/mixing sounds with portaudio made easy!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cargo">FunLibs/Cargo</a></h4>
        <p>Simple argv parser inspired by the Go flag API.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/funlibs/clog">FunLibs/Clog</a></h4>
        <p>A simple logging library.</p>
