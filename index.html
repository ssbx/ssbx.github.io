        <h1>Wellcome to my personal page!</h1>
        <p>This is a page about a guy who like to understand how things are working.</p>
        <h2>My things</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/supercastframework">Supercast</a></h3>
        <p>The first work on Supercast was around 2011, when the rfc6455 (WebSocket Protocol) was close to become a standard. There was some early implementations of it in Erlang, so I began to learn this nice language. There was not, and in my opinion there is still not today, any libraries/frameworks allowing to efficiently create maintainable applications offering soft real time behaviour to the user interface. Supercast is a solutions to this need. I have used it successfuly in my actual main project Sysmo-NMS.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.sysmo.io">Sysmo-NMS</a></h3>
        <p>It is actually the main project I work on. There is a commercial website. Take a look if you wish :)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/sysmo-nms/nchecks">NChecks</a></h3>
        <p>The work on NChecks began with Sysmo, wile working on nagios-plugins compatibility. Nagios-plugins are popular because they are so simple to write. But I found there are some major drawbacks. NChecks fix problems like portability, possiblity to store a state between checks, many alternative status. It is a major subproject success of the Sysmo thing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/funlibs">FunLibs</a></h3>
        <p>While having worked with lot of programming and scripting langages, I find myself missing some experience in C language. I've started learning and creating some libs. The first were <a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cargo">Cargo</a>, a simple argc/argv parser and <a href="https://github.com/funlibs/clog">Clog</a>, a log library. After having created some more libs i decided to create the github funlibs org to host the code in a coherent way. It now include many libs around multimedia oriented applications (games), like playing/mixing sounds with portaudio (<a href="https://github.com/funlibs/libshake">LibShake</a>), mathematics for OpenGL (<a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cglm">CGLM</a>), fork of some utilities (mostly modified for CMake compat). Most (all) of these libs are used by my Federation pet project.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ssbx/federation">Federation</a></h3>
        <p>The name mean nothing, but it is about a FPS game writen entirely in C.</p>
