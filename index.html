        <h1>Welcome to the SÃ©bastien Serre personal page!</h1>
        <h2>My things</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/supercastframework">Supercast</a></h3>
        <p>The first work on Supercast was made around 2011, when the rfc6455 (WebSocket Protocol) was close to becoming a standard. There were some early implementations of it in Erlang, so I began to learn this nice language. There were no, and in my opinion there still aren't, any libraries/frameworks allowing to efficiently create maintainable applications offering soft real time behaviour to the user interface. Supercast is a solution to this need. I have used it successfully in my current main project Sysmo-NMS.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.sysmo.io">Sysmo-NMS</a></h3>
        <p>It is the main project I'm working on these days. There is a commercial website. Take a look if you wish :)</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/sysmo-nms/nchecks">NChecks</a></h3>
        <p>The work on NChecks began with Sysmo, while working on nagios-plugins compatibility. Nagios-plugins are popular because they are so simple to write. But I found there are some major drawbacks. NChecks fixes problems like portability, possibility to store a state between checks, many alternative status. It is a major sub-project success of the Sysmo thing!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/funlibs">FunLibs</a></h3>
        <p>While having worked with lot of programming and scripting languages, I find myself missing some experience in C language. I've started learning and creating some libs. The first were <a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cargo">Cargo</a>, a simple argc/argv parser and <a href="https://github.com/funlibs/clog">Clog</a>, a log library. After having created some more libs I decided to create the github funlibs org to host the code in a coherent way. It now includes many libs around multimedia oriented applications (games), like playing/mixing sounds with portaudio (<a href="https://github.com/funlibs/libshake">LibShake</a>), mathematics for OpenGL (<a href="https://github.com/funlibs/cglm">CGLM</a>), fork of some utilities (mostly modified for CMake compat). Most (all) of these libs are used by my Federation pet project.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ssbx/federation">Federation</a></h3>
        <p>The name means nothing, but it is about a FPS game written entirely in C.</p>
